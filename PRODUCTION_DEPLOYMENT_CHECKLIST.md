# Production Deployment Checklist for GhostliAI

## 1. PayPal Production Setup
### Required Environment Variables:
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - Your production PayPal Client ID
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your production PayPal Client Secret

### Setup Steps:
1. Create PayPal Business Account at https://developer.paypal.com
2. Create a Production App in PayPal Developer Dashboard
3. Get your Live Client ID and Secret (not sandbox)
4. Set environment variables in Replit Deployment settings
5. Test with small transaction amounts first

### Current Status:
- ✅ PayPal integration code is production-ready
- ❌ Production PayPal credentials needed in deployment environment

## 2. OpenAI Production Configuration
### Required Environment Variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your production OpenAI API key with sufficient credits

### Optimizations Implemented:
- ✅ Rate limiting: 50 requests/minute, 40K tokens/minute
- ✅ Cost monitoring and tracking
- ✅ Token usage optimization
- ✅ Error handling and retries
- ✅ Response time monitoring

### Recommended Setup:
1. Use OpenAI API key with sufficient monthly credits ($100+ recommended)
2. Set up billing alerts in OpenAI dashboard
3. Monitor usage through built-in cost tracking

## 3. Database Performance Optimizations
### Implemented:
- ✅ Connection pooling configuration
- ✅ Optimized queries with column selection
- ✅ Batch operations for credit updates
- ✅ Automatic data cleanup (30-day retention)
- ✅ Performance monitoring queries
- ✅ Database health checks

### Tables Added:
- `api_usage_logs` - API call monitoring
- `cost_tracking` - Daily cost aggregation
- `performance_metrics` - Response time tracking

## 4. Rate Limiting & Security
### Implemented:
- ✅ General rate limiting: 100 requests/15 minutes per IP
- ✅ Content generation: 10 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ AI detection: 20 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ Payment endpoints: 5 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ Gzip compression for all responses
- ✅ Security headers with Helmet.js
- ✅ Request/response logging

## 5. Monitoring & Alerting
### Implemented:
- ✅ API usage tracking
- ✅ Cost monitoring per service
- ✅ Response time monitoring
- ✅ Error rate tracking
- ✅ Daily statistics aggregation

### Alert Thresholds:
- Error rate > 5%
- Average response time > 5 seconds
- Cost > $10/hour

## 6. Concurrent User Capacity
### Estimated Capacity:
- **Small Commercial Launch**: 50-200 concurrent users
- **Peak Capacity**: 500-1000 users (with optimizations)
- **Bottlenecks**: OpenAI API rate limits, database performance

### Scaling Recommendations:
1. Monitor OpenAI API usage closely
2. Implement user queuing for high-demand periods
3. Consider caching for frequently generated content types
4. Upgrade OpenAI plan for higher rate limits if needed

## 7. Deployment Steps
1. **Set Environment Variables in Replit:**
   ```
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_paypal_client_id
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_paypal_secret
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_openai_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Deploy to Replit Production:**
   - Click "Deploy" button in Replit
   - Configure custom domain if desired
   - Enable automatic deployments

3. **Test Critical Flows:**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Content generation with credit deduction
   - PayPal payment processing
   - AI Detection Shield functionality

4. **Monitor Launch:**
   - Check `/api/system/health` endpoint
   - Monitor API usage logs
   - Watch for error rates and response times

## 8. Post-Launch Monitoring
### Daily Checks:
- API cost tracking
- Error rates
- User signup/retention metrics
- Payment success rates

### Weekly Reviews:
- Performance optimization opportunities
- User feedback integration
- Feature usage analytics
- Cost optimization

## 9. Emergency Procedures
### If API Costs Spike:
1. Check OpenAI usage in admin dashboard
2. Implement temporary rate limiting
3. Review user activity for abuse

### If Payment Issues Occur:
1. Check PayPal webhook logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test with PayPal sandbox first

### If Performance Degrades:
1. Check database health endpoint
2. Review API response times
3. Scale resources if needed

## 10. Success Metrics for Commercial Launch
- **User Acquisition**: Target 100+ signups in first week
- **Payment Conversion**: Target 20%+ of users purchasing credits
- **API Reliability**: >99% uptime, <5% error rate
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$5 per user in API costs
- **Performance**: <3 second average response times
