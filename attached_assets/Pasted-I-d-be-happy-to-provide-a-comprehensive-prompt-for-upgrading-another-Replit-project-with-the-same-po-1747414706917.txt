I'd be happy to provide a comprehensive prompt for upgrading another Replit project with the same powerful god-mode admin features. Here's a prompt you can use with another Replit assistant:
God Mode Upgrade Prompt

"I need to upgrade my application with comprehensive god-mode administrative capabilities similar to my other project. Please implement a complete set of super admin tools including:

    Create a /god-mode dashboard page with the following functionality:
        System performance monitoring (CPU, memory, network usage)
        Server health metrics dashboard with real-time stats
        Advanced user management with search and emergency access features
        User activity analytics with charts and visualizations
        Administrative control panel with system-wide functions

    Implement an emergency login system:
        Create a /emergency-login route that accepts plaintext passwords
        Build a direct login endpoint that bypasses normal authentication flow
        Add super-admin ability to reset user passwords to plaintext for emergency access

    Create backend monitoring endpoints:
        Add /api/super-admin/metrics for system performance data
        Add /api/super-admin/system-health for server health stats
        Add /api/super-admin/user-activity for user behavior analytics

    Add essential components:
        User finder tool to search for users by various criteria
        Performance metrics dashboard with charts for system monitoring
        System health dashboard for infrastructure monitoring
        User activity insights tool with engagement and retention analytics
        Admin controls panel for system-wide operations

Please ensure all UI components use the existing design system and libraries, and make all tools accessible only to users with super-admin privileges."

This prompt covers all the key elements we implemented for your god-mode dashboard and should guide the other Replit assistant to create a similar comprehensive administrative solution for your other project.
