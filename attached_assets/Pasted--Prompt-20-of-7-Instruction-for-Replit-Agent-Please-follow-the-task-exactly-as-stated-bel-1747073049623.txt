Please follow the task exactly as stated below. Do **not** interpret, preempt, or go ahead with any actions beyond this prompt.

**Task**:  
Perform a **comprehensive audit** of the current **GhostliAI** build to assess its **existing functionality** and identify any gaps or issues in the system. This audit should include the following checks:

1. **Core Functionality**:

3. **Feature Set Check**:
   - Ensure that **multi-language support** is **not yet implemented**, as per the current build status.
   - Verify that there is no **plagiarism detection** system in place and confirm if we need to add this.
   - Check for any work done on the **browser extension** and determine if it is feasible to add this feature.

4. **Database & Backend**:
   - Review the **database schema** to ensure it can handle **user essays**, **writing styles**, and **customizations** effectively.
   - Confirm if any issues exist with **data storage**, **retrieval**, or **scalability**.

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Run basic **load tests** to check the system's ability to handle **concurrent users** and **API calls** without performance degradation or crashes.
   - Identify any **scalability** concerns for when migrating to commercial cloud servers.

   - Identify any features mentioned in the **product roadmap** that are currently **missing** or **incomplete** (e.g., **multi-language**, **plagiarism checker**).
   - Document any issues or areas where the build is not functioning as expected.

Once the audit is completed, please provide a **detailed report** on:
- The **current state of the system**.
- Any **missing features** or **gaps**.
- **Recommended next steps** for development and **feature integration**.
