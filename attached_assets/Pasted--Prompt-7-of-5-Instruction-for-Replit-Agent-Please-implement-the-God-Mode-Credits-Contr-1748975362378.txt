**Prompt 7 of 5**

**Instruction for Replit Agent**:  
Please implement the **God Mode Credits Control System** inside the existing **Supergod dashboard**.  

This must include the following 3 features:

---

**1️⃣ Per-User Token Exemption Toggle**

- Add new field to `users` table:  
    - `credit_exempt` BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
- In Supergod dashboard → add **Credits Management panel**:
    - Display list of users (table or dropdown search)
    - For each user, show **current credit_exempt status** (true/false)
    - Provide a **toggle switch** to set credit_exempt ON/OFF
    - When set to true → user will not consume credits when generating content.

---

**2️⃣ Manual Credit Allocation (Per User)**

- In Credits Management panel:
    - For each user, show **current credits balance**
    - Provide **input field** and **Add Credits** button
    - On submit:
        - Add specified credits to `users.credits`
        - Insert record into `credit_transactions`:
            - transaction_type = ADJUSTMENT
            - amount = (entered value)
            - source = MANUAL
            - tx_id = NULL
- Show success/failure message after submission.

---

**3️⃣ Global Setting: Default First-Time Subscriber Credits**

- Add new global config variable: `default_first_time_credits` (integer).
- In Credits Management panel:
    - Show current value of `default_first_time_credits`
    - Provide **input field** to change value and Save button.
    - When updated, new users registering or subscribing will be granted this amount of credits automatically.
    - No retroactive change to existing users.

---

**UI Integration Notes**:

✅ Place new **Credits Management panel** in existing Supergod dashboard.  
✅ Clearly label all controls.  
✅ Ensure responsive layout (desktop/mobile).  
✅ Protect with Supergod permission checks.  

---

**Testing Checklist**:

✅ Toggle `credit_exempt` ON → user should generate content without consuming credits.  
✅ Toggle `credit_exempt` OFF → credits should be consumed normally.  
✅ Manually add credits → balance updates, `credit_transactions` recorded.  
✅ Change `default_first_time_credits` → new users get correct initial credits.  
✅ UI behaves correctly across all devices.
