**Prompt 10 of 7**

**Instruction for Replit Agent**:  
Please follow the task exactly as stated below. Do **not** interpret, preempt, or go ahead with any actions beyond this prompt.

**Task**:  
Refactor and implement the following updates to the **WriteRIGHT-01/OM-7** content generation process:

1. **Word Count Input**:  
   - Add a **word count input field** next to the content parameters, allowing the operator to specify the **desired word count** for the generated content. 
   - Implement a **word count validator** to ensure the output is as close as possible to the requested word count.

2. **Iterative Content Generation Process**:  
   - Do not return the **first draft** generated by GPT. Implement a **looping process** where the output is iterated and self-questioned until it aligns with the following:
     - The **content tone** (e.g., casual, formal, authoritative, etc.).
     - The **brand archetype** (e.g., Hero, Outlaw, etc.).
     - The **word count** is accurate.
   - Include **self-analysis** during the process, checking if the content aligns with the given instructions and **adjust** accordingly.

3. **Anti-AI Detection & Humanization Process**:  
   - Apply **anti-AI detection techniques** to the generated content, ensuring it passes third-party AI detection tools (e.g., GPTZero, Writer).
     - Implement **sentence restructuring**, **randomized punctuation**, and **controlled imperfections** (slight typos, filler words, etc.) to ensure the content appears **human-written**.
     - Ensure the multi-step humanization process is applied before output is finalized.

4. **Speed Optimization**:  
   - The process should still complete within **30 seconds** while ensuring the content meets the above criteria.
   - Optimize the system so that content is **processed, analyzed, and adjusted** as needed without excessive delays.

5. **Fixing Output Issue**:  
   - Ensure that the content **generated from the user input** is returned as output.
     - The tool should not just return the **original prompt**, but should **process** the prompt and generate meaningful, humanized content based on the specified parameters.
   
Once these changes are implemented, please confirm the adjustments and test the content generation flow to ensure it meets all requirements.
