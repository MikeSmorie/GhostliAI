**Prompt 6 of 5**

**Instruction for Replit Agent**:  
Implement a new **"Credits Management" panel** inside the existing **Supergod dashboard** in GhostliAI.  
This panel should provide the following 3 Supergod controls:

---

**1️⃣ Per-User Token Exemption Toggle**

- Add new field `credit_exempt` (boolean, default false) to `users` table.
- In Credits Management panel:
    - List all users (table view or dropdown search)
    - Display current `credit_exempt` status
    - Provide toggle ON/OFF control
- In content generation flow:  
    - If `credit_exempt = true`, skip credit deduction and allow unlimited use.

---

**2️⃣ Manual Credit Allocation (Per User)**

- In Credits Management panel:
    - For each user, display current `credits` balance.
    - Provide an "Add Credits" input field + submit button.
    - When submitted:
        - Add specified amount to `users.credits`.
        - Insert corresponding `credit_transactions` record with:
            - transaction_type = ADJUSTMENT
            - amount = entered value
            - source = MANUAL
            - tx_id = NULL
- Display success/failure notification.

---

**3️⃣ Default First-Time Subscriber Credits**

- Add new global setting: `default_first_time_credits` (integer).
- In Credits Management panel:
    - Display current value.
    - Provide input to change value + save button.
    - When a new user is created (registration or first payment), grant this amount of credits automatically.

---

**Additional UI Requirements**:

- Place this Credits Management panel clearly within the existing **Supergod dashboard**.
- Display current **user credits**, **credit_exempt status**, and allow searching/filtering users.
- Ensure responsive design (desktop & mobile).
- All actions should be protected by proper Supergod-level permission checks.

---

**Final Testing Checklist**:

✅ Toggling credit_exempt ON/OFF works in real time.  
✅ Adding credits manually updates user balance correctly.  
✅ Changing `default_first_time_credits` applies to new users.  
✅ All actions logged in `credit_transactions` for audit.  
✅ Content generation respects credit_exempt flag.
