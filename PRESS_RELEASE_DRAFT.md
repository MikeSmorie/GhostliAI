**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## GhostliAI Launches: The AI Writing Tool That Bypasses Detection

**Revolutionary Platform Empowers Writers to Humanize AI Content and Protect Creative Freedom**

**Cape Town, South Africa** — GhostliAI (https://ghostliai.com), a groundbreaking new AI writing platform, officially launches today, offering users the ability to generate humanized, undetectable AI content with unprecedented sophistication.

As AI detection systems grow more aggressive across educational institutions, publishers, and search engines, GhostliAI empowers content creators to maintain control over their work while leveraging artificial intelligence as a legitimate writing assistant.

Built by entrepreneur and author Michael Smorenburg, GhostliAI represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted writing, featuring:

✅ **Advanced Anti-AI Detection Algorithms** — Sophisticated humanization technology that bypasses GPTZero, Turnitin, Copyleaks, and other detection systems

✅ **Personalized "Clone Me" Writing Style Engine** — Revolutionary technology that analyzes user writing samples to replicate individual voice and style patterns

✅ **Comprehensive Writing Support** — Full-spectrum assistance for academic research, commercial copywriting, creative content, and professional communications

✅ **Live AI Detection Shield** — Real-time verification system that tests content against multiple detection platforms before publication

✅ **Transparent Credit-Based Model** — Ethical pricing structure with no hidden fees, automatic PRO tier upgrades, and clear usage tracking

### Addressing the AI Detection Crisis

Recent studies indicate that AI detection tools produce false positive rates exceeding 26%, flagging legitimate human-written content as machine-generated. This has created significant barriers for students, journalists, content creators, and professionals who use AI tools ethically as writing assistants.

"GhostliAI is about restoring agency to the writer," says founder Michael Smorenburg. "Whether you're a student researching a thesis, a journalist meeting deadlines, a copywriter serving clients, or a creator building an audience — you deserve to own your output without being constrained by arbitrary technological gatekeepers."

### Technical Innovation

The platform employs proprietary humanization algorithms that introduce natural writing variations, including:

- **Contextual Imperfection Modeling** — Strategic insertion of human-like grammatical variations and stylistic inconsistencies
- **Voice Preservation Technology** — Advanced analysis that maintains author authenticity while adding humanization layers
- **Multi-Detector Bypass Verification** — Comprehensive testing against industry-standard detection systems
- **Adaptive Learning Systems** — Continuous improvement based on detection pattern evolution

### Market Positioning and Ethics

GhostliAI addresses legitimate use cases where AI detection creates false barriers to productivity and creativity. The platform emphasizes responsible AI assistance rather than deceptive content generation, targeting professionals who use AI tools transparently within their workflows.

"We're not enabling deception — we're preventing discrimination," Smorenburg explains. "AI should enhance human capability, not replace human authorship. Our users maintain full creative control while leveraging technology to overcome artificial limitations."

### Launch Details and Availability

GhostliAI launches with a freemium model, providing new users with starter credits to explore the platform's capabilities. Early adopters receive founding member benefits including:

The platform supports multiple content types including blog posts, academic papers, marketing copy, creative writing, and professional communications, with word counts ranging from short-form social media content to comprehensive long-form documents.

### Industry Impact

The launch comes amid growing tension between AI adoption and detection technology deployment across sectors. Educational institutions, content platforms, and employers increasingly rely on detection systems that often flag legitimate work, creating productivity barriers and ethical concerns about technological overreach.

GhostliAI's approach focuses on empowering users rather than circumventing legitimate oversight, positioning AI as a collaborative tool that enhances rather than replaces human creativity and critical thinking.

### Future Development

The company plans continued platform enhancement including expanded language support, advanced style customization options, industry-specific writing modules, and integration capabilities with popular content management systems.
